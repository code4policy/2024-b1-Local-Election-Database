        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>This team was brought together in January 2024 by Programming and Data for Policymakers, a course at Harvard Kennedy School. Instructors Professor Druhmil Mehta and Aarushi Sahejpal tasked us with using our new skills in programming to create a useful and effective website.</p>

        <p>With a shared background in public service and passion for democracy and representation, we decided to bring the Local Elections Database to life. Prior to this project, the Local Elections Database existed as a working paper and in spreadsheets. We wanted to create visualizations so that everyone could quickly answer the question: Just how representative is local government? </p>
