        <h1>Welcome to the Local Elections Database Project</h1>
        <h2>Answering the question: Just how representative is local government? 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Local government operates close to home. From trash pickup to snow removal and emergency services, you find local government at almost every street corner. But does close proximity equate to better representation for and of constituents?
        </p>
        <p>
            The U.S. Congress is notoriously <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/07/the-changing-face-of-congress/"> out of step with the American population</a>. Women comprise only 28% of Congress while making up more than half of the U.S. population (51%). Representation is also elusive for people of color, young people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, it has been difficult to analyze trends in 
            descriptive representation like this at the local level.

            Sparse data existed on local elections and officials like mayors, city councilors, sheriffs, and school board members. However, in 2022, Justin de Benedictis-Kessner (Harvard Kennedy School), Diana Da In Lee (Columbia University), Yamil Velez (Columbia University), and Christopher Warshaw (Georgia Washington University) released a new, comprehensive database of about 78,000 candidates in 57,500 local electoral contests between 1989-2021. The novel dataset contains information on candidates, election results, and key demographics, including race and gender. Read more about the work in <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37373139/RWP22_013_deBenedictisKessner_v2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">this paper</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
    
           To bring the dataset to life, the Local Elections Database Project team, a part of Harvard Kennedy School's class Programming and Data for Policymakers (DPI 691-M), is visualizing the representativeness of various electoral contests. We hope that the people engaged in making communities across the country more representative will find these displays illustrative and useful.

        <h2>How should I use this website?</h2>
        <p>This website is a work in progress. We are continuing to add visualizations and data breakdowns over time. The first area we targeted was gender representation. We encourage you to: <ol>
            <li>Read through our summary statistics</li>
            <li>View various visualizations on gender representation in local office</li>
            <li>Screenshot, copy, or otherwise share what you learn!</li></ol></p>

        <h2>Where can I learn more about this project?</h2>
        <p>
            We owe our source data to the American Local Government Elections Database. If you would like to learn more about that database, you can access it online.
