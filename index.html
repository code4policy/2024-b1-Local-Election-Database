    <h1>Welcome to the Local Elections Database Project</h1>
    <h2>
        Just how representative is local government? 
    </h2>
        <h3>New data illustrate how much local elected official demographics mirror their constituencies.</h3>
        <p>
            Local government operates notoriously close to home. From trash pickup to snow removal and emergency services, you can find local government at almost every street corner. But does a close physical proximity equate to better representation for constituents?
        </p>
        <p>
            The U.S. Congress is notoriously <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/07/the-changing-face-of-congress/"> out of step with the American population</a>. Women comprise only 28% of Congress while women are more than half of the U.S. population (51%). Representation is also elusive for people of color, young people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. 
        </p>

            Historically, it has been difficult to analyze trends in 
            descriptive representation at the local level.

            Sparse data existed on local elections and officials like mayors, city councilors, sheriffs, and school board members. However, in 2022, Justin de Benedictis-Kessner (Harvard Kennedy School), Diana Da In Lee (Columbia University), Yamil Velez (Columbia University), and Christopher Warshaw (Georgia Washington University) released a new, comprehensive database of about 78,000 candidates in 57,500 local electoral contests between 1989-2021. The novel dataset contains information on candidates, election results, and key demographics, including race and gender. Read more about the work in <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37373139/RWP22_013_deBenedictisKessner_v2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">this paper</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To make these results accessible, the Local Elections Database team of DPI 691-M has visualized the representativeness of various electoral contests. We hope that the people engaged in making their communities more representative will find these displays illustrative and useful. An important part of making our voices heard is for our government to reflect on various lived experiences.
