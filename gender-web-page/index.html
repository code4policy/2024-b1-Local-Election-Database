    <h1>Are women well represented in local offices?</h1>
    <h2>Quick breakdown</h2>
    <p>Women remain under-represented in the majority of local offices. According to the Local Elections Database:<ul>
        <li>In city council elections, women won less than 37.5% of all available seats, despite women on average representing 50% or more of the population.</li>
        <li>In effect, women were 40% less likely than men to win a city council election in 2020.</li>
        <li>And that represents an <em>improvement</em> over historical trends: in 2004, women won less than 31% of all available seats.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>An important caveat:</b> the universe of the <a href=citation-page/index.html>dataset</a> is not fully comprehensive. First, the databse only catalogs cities, counties, and school districts with a population of at least 50,000 in 2020. And some elections have data the authors could not locate. These could exist for smaller geographic units or elections that public datasets did not reveal.  
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in the medium and larger-sized communities that the dataset encompasses, <b>the message is clear: all across the country, women do not have the same representation as men.</b> The following visualizations offer some insights into where female under-representation is happening the most.
