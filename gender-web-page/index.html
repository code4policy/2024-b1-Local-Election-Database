    <h1>Are women well represented in local offices?</h1>
    <h2>A Numbers Breakdown</h2>
    <p>Women remain under-represented in the majority of local offices. According to the Local Elections Database:<ul>
        <li>In city council elections, women won less than 37.5% of all available seats, despite women on average representing 50% or more of the population.</li>
        <li>In effect, women were 40% less likely than men to win a city council election in 2020.</li>
        <li>And that represents an <em>improvement</em> over historical trends: in 2004, women won less than 31% of all available seats.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>An important caveat:</b> the universe of the <a href="citation-page/index.html">dataset</a> is not fully comprehensive. First, the databse only catalogs cities, counties, and school districts with a population of at least 50,000 in 2020. And some elections have data the authors could not locate. These could exist for smaller geographic units or elections that public datasets did not reveal.  
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in the medium and larger-sized communities that the dataset encompasses, <b>the message is clear: all across the country, women do not have the same representation as men.</b> The following visualizations offer some insights into where female under-representation is happening the most.

            <h2>Are women represented in the office as county executive?
            <h3>Judging on a scale from 1-10, 60% of the county gets a 0 for female representation in the office of county executive.</h3>
            <p>The Local Elections Database holds the results of county executive elections for 126 counties (out of 3,143) in the US. Here, we visualized the counties by the female gender representation. The color is assigned by a simple gender representation score given by the ratio of female county executives within the available data, scaled to a 10-point scale and rounded to the nearest whole number, where a 0 means that no women have been elected, a 5 indicated gender parity and a 10 overrepresentation of women. In sum, the data show nearly <b>60% of the county gets a 0 for female representation</b>. </p>

            <h3>If we use a traditional statistics test we find 47% of the counties exhibit a gender bias in their election results.</h3>
            <p>In this visualization, we have presented the counties according to the outcomes of the Chi-squared test, which was conducted under the assumption of a 1:1 gender distribution with a significance level of p < 0.05. The analysis reveals that approximately <b>47% of the counties exhibit a gender bias in their election results</b>. This significant finding underscores the urgent need for enhanced gender representation in regional political landscapes, calling attention to the disparities that currently exist.
